# PostGRE-SQL-Project

In this notebook, I have analyzed international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. The SQL queries attempt to find the answers to questions such as:

1) What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
2) Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
3) What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?
